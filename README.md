# Doxygen::Filter::Moon

## Version 1.0

* Doxygen::Filter::Moon - A moonscript code pre-filter for Doxygen
  * Based on **[doxygen-filter-perl](https://github.com/jordan2175/doxygen-filter-perl)**


## MOTIVATION

* I wanted to learn how to write a filter for Doxygen. Since i already use it for my C/CPP projects i was curious if i can make a filter for Moonscript.
  * FYI: There is already an existing tool to generate docs for MoonScript (**[Ldoc](https://lunarmodules.github.io/ldoc/manual/manual.md.html#Moonscript_Support)**), it is what i've been using in my other projects.
* I wanted to learn Perl since i've never used it and this is my first project with it. And i was lucky enough to find a reference to follow **[doxygen-filter-perl](https://github.com/jordan2175/doxygen-filter-perl)**
* Lastly i wanted to give my self options ;)
